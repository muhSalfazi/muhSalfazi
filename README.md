  <h2 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; color: #ffffff;">About Me</h2>
  <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; color: #dcdcdc;">I am a 6th-semester student at Universitas Buana Perjuangan Karawang with a strong passion for backend web development. Experienced in using Laravel and related technologies, I am dedicated to building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly web applications.

I have completed a 3-month internship as a Web Developer, where I worked on backend development, database optimization, and API implementation. This experience has enhanced my skills in system architecture management, application performance improvement, and understanding software development needs in a professional environment.

I am always eager to learn about the latest technologies, stay updated with industry trends, and collaborate on innovative projects.

I am open to collaboration, internships, or roles in Web Development & Backend Engineering. Letâ€™s connect and explore opportunities together!
